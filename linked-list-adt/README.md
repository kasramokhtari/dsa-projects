Description of files used to create the List ADT


List.h - The List.h file is used in this project as a file to put the declarations of the variables, functions, and types. It is also used as a way to specify all the functions and structs from the List.c file that the user can use.

List.c - This is where the implementation of these functions and types go. 

ListTest.c - This was a file used to test the functions that were used to implement the List ADT. It checked each function for different types of cases of use to ensure that it works as intended by the instructions.

Lex.c - This is the file that takes in two files which are an input and an output file, takes in the contents of the input file, sorts the data alphabetically, and writes it to the output file

Makefile - This file is used for creating an executable Lex file and ListTest file to run to be able to run both the Lex.c and ListTest.c files

README.md - This is the file this text is currently in, used to explain the functionality of each program in this project.
