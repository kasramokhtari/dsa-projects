# Dictionary using Red-Black Tree

An enhanced Dictionary ADT in C++ backed by a balanced Red-Black Tree. Builds upon the BST Dictionary to support self-balancing operations for improved performance. Includes `Order.cpp` and `WordFrequency.cpp`, a client that computes word frequency counts from large text files like Shakespeare's works or Project Gutenberg texts.
