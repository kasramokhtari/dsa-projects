# Perfect Shuffle Simulator

A C++ program that models riffle shuffling on decks of size `n`, using a custom List ADT implemented with a doubly linked list and cursor-based navigation. The program computes how many perfect shuffles are needed to return a deck to its original order for values of `n` from 1 up to a given input. Includes full operator overloading and robust ADT testing.
