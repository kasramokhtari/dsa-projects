# Dictionary using Binary Search Tree

A C++ Dictionary ADT implemented using a binary search tree (BST). Stores (key, value) pairs with unique string keys and supports fast insertion, deletion, and traversal. The client program `Order.cpp` reads lines from an input file and outputs an ordered dictionary and a pre-order traversal of keys.
